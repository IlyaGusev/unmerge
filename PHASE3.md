# UNMERGE Phase 3: Reducing Task Vectors Dimensionality

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 successfully implemented binary mask-based dimensionality reduction for task vectors, compressing them from ~822M parameters to exactly 99,904 parameters (~100k target) - achieving a compression ratio of **8,228x** while preserving essential weight information through magnitude-based selection.

## Methodology

### Algorithm Implementation

Following the UNMERGE proposal specification, Phase 3 implemented the exact algorithm:

1. **LoRA Expansion to Full Weights**: Converted LoRA adapters (rank-32) to full weight space using ΔW = LoRA_B @ LoRA_A
2. **Magnitude Aggregation**: Applied max operation across all 8 task adapters
3. **Top-k Selection Per Module**: Selected top-892 weights per attention module (q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj) across 28 layers
4. **Binary Mask Creation**: Generated unified selection mask with exactly 99,904 parameters
5. **Vector Compression**: Applied mask to all task vectors and target vectors

### Required Tasks Processing

All 8 mandated tasks were successfully processed as a dictionary for a selection mask:
- latin_translation
- codesearchnet_python  
- python_instructions_alpaca
- alpaca_instructions
- ms_marco_qa
- xsum
- reason_math
- gsm8k_math
