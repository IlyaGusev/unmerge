Message 2 (user):
Sally had 13 peaches at her roadside fruit dish.  She went to the orchard and picked peaches to stock up. She picked 55 peaches. There are _____ peaches now.

Message 3 (assistant):
Sally originally had 13 peaches. She picked 55 more peaches. To find out the total number of peaches she has now, we add the two amounts together:

13 (original peaches) + 55 (picked peaches) = 68 peaches

So, there are 68 peaches now.

Message 2 (user):
two stations p and q are 200 km apart on a straight track . one train starts from p at 7 a . m . and travels towards q at 20 kmph . another train starts from q at 8 a . m . and travels towards p at a speed of 25 kmph . at what time will they meet ?

Message 3 (assistant):
Let's calculate the distance covered by the first train from P before the second train starts from Q.

The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., so there is a 1-hour difference. In this 1 hour, the first train would have covered a distance of 20 km/h * 1 h = 20 km.

Now, the remaining distance between the two trains after the second train starts is 200 km - 20 km = 180 km.

Both trains are now moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 20 km/h + 25 km/h = 45 km/h.

To find the time it takes for them to meet, we divide the remaining distance by their relative speed:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 180 km / 45 km/h
Time = 4 hours

Since the second train starts at 8 a.m., they will meet 4 hours later, which is at 8 a.m. + 4 hours = 12 p.m. (noon).

Message 2 (user):
In a recent election, Geoff received a certain percent of the 6000 votes cast. To win the election, a candidate needed to receive more than 50.5% of the vote. Geoff needed exactly 3000 more votes to win the election. What percent of the votes did Geoff initially receive?

Message 3 (assistant):
To win the election, a candidate needed to receive more than 50.5% of the 6000 votes. Let's first calculate the number of votes that represent 50.5% of 6000:

50.5% of 6000 = 0.505 * 6000 = 3030 votes

To win, Geoff would need one more vote than this, which is 3031 votes. However, we are told that Geoff needed exactly 3000 more votes to win the election. This means Geoff initially received:

3031 votes (to win) - 3000 votes (needed more) = 31 votes

Geoff initially received 31 votes out of 6000. To find the percentage of votes Geoff received, we divide the number of votes he received by the total number of votes and then multiply by 100:

(31 / 6000) * 100 = 0.5167%

Geoff initially received approximately 0.52% of the votes.
