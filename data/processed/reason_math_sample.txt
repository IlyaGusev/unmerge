Message 2 (user):
Given a square \(ABCD\) with point \(P\) inside such that \(PA = 1\), \(PB = 2\), and \(PC = 3\), calculate the angle \(\widehat{APB}\).

Message 3 (assistant):

1. **Rotation and Initial Observations:**
   Let $\rho$ be the rotation centered at $B$ with an angle of $90^\circ$. This rotation sends point $C$ to point $A$, keeps $B$ fixed, and sends $P$ to a point $P'$ such that $\angle PBP' = 90^\circ$. Additionally, since this is a rotation by $90^\circ$, the distance $P'B$ will remain equal to $PB$, which is $2$ units.

2. **Isometry Properties:**
   Since $\rho$ is an isometry (it preserves distances), it follows that:
   \[
   P'B = PB = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad P'A = PC = 3.
   \]
   Therefore, point $P'$ is positioned such that the distances from $B$ and $A$ are known.

3. **Pythagorean Theorem Application:**
   Consider the right triangle $\triangle PBP'$. By the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   PP' = \sqrt{PB^2 + P'B^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}.
   \]
   
4. **Right-Angle Theorem:**
   Using the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, since $PP' = 2\sqrt{2}$ in the right triangle $\triangle PBP'$, this confirms that $\triangle PBP'$ is a right triangle with $\angle PBP' = 90^\circ$.

5. **Determining $\angle APP'$:**
   Now consider the triangle $\triangle PAP'$. Since $P'B = 2$, $PA = 1$, and $P'A=3$, and since we have already shown that $\triangle PBP'$ is a right triangle, it follows by geometric properties and distances that:
   \[
   \triangle PAP' \text{ is a right triangle at } P.
   \]

6. **Summing Angles:**
   Since $PBP'$ forms a right angle and $PB$ is half of an isosceles right triangle, we can conclude $\angle PBP'$ is $45^\circ$. Therefore, summing angles in $\triangle PAP'$:
   \[
   \widehat{APB} = \widehat{APP'} + \widehat{PP'B} = 90^\circ + 45^\circ = 135^\circ.
   \]

### Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]

Message 2 (user):
Petya and Misha start on a circular track from the same point, running in a counterclockwise direction. Both run at constant speeds, with Misha's speed being $2\%$ greater than Petya's speed. Petya always runs counterclockwise, while Misha can change direction at any moment, provided he has run at least half a lap or more in one direction. Show that while Petya completes his first lap, Misha can meet (either encounter or catch up with) him three times, not counting the starting point.

Message 3 (assistant):

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let:
   - $v_P$ be Petya's running speed.
   - $v_M$ be Misha's running speed.
   - $L$ be the length of the circular track.

2. **Speed Relationship:**
   According to the problem, Misha’s speed is $2\%$ more than Petya’s speed:
   \[
   v_M = 1.02 \cdot v_P
   \]

3. **First Encounter:**
   Initially, both start at the same point and run in the same direction. Assume Misha runs $\frac{L}{2}$ distance (halfway around the track) and then turns back.
   - Time taken for Misha to run $\frac{L}{2}$:
   \[
   t_1 = \frac{L}{2v_M}
   \]
   - In this time, Petya runs:
   \[
   d_1 = v_P \cdot t_1 = v_P \cdot \frac{L}{2v_M} = \frac{v_P \cdot L}{2 \cdot 1.02 \cdot v_P} = \frac{L}{2.04}
   \]
   Since Misha starts running back from the halfway mark, they will meet.

4. **Second Encounter:**
   After meeting for the first time, assume both continue in the opposite directions until they again meet after another $\frac{L}{2}$ relative distance.
   - Combined speed of Petya and Misha when running towards each other:
   \[
   v_{\text{relative}} = v_P + v_M = v_P + 1.02 \cdot v_P = 2.02 \cdot v_P
   \]
   - Time taken to meet again:
   \[
   t_2 = \frac{\frac{L}{2}}{v_{\text{relative}}} = \frac{\frac{L}{2}}{2.02 \cdot v_P} = \frac{L}{4.04 \cdot v_P}
   \]

5. **Third Encounter:**
   After the second meeting, Misha continues running until another $\frac{L}{2}$ distance relative to Petya.
   - Time taken for the third encounter:
   \[
   t_3 = t_2
   \]
   
6. **Total Time to Complete One Lap by Petya:**
   Calculate the total time for Petya to complete one full lap:
   \[
   t_P = \frac{L}{v_P}
   \]

7. **Number of Encounters:**
   - Time for three encounters:
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = \frac{L}{2.04 \cdot v_P} + \frac{L}{4.04 \cdot v_P} + \frac{L}{4.04 \cdot v_P} 
   \]
   - Simplify:
   \[
   t_{\text{total}}  = \frac{L}{2.04 \cdot v_P} + 2 \cdot \frac{L}{4.04 \cdot v_P}
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   Misha manages to meet Petya three times while Petya completes his first lap around the track due to the above calculations, which confirms the problem statement.

\[
\boxed{3}
\]

Message 2 (user):
In $\triangle ABC$, given $a + c = 3b$, with incenter $I$, the incircle touches sides $AB$ and $BC$ at points $D$ and $E$, respectively. Let $K$ be the symmetric point of $D$ with respect to $I$, and $L$ be the symmetric point of $E$ with respect to $I$. Prove that the points $A$, $C$, $K$, and $L$ are concyclic.

Message 3 (assistant):
1. **Identify Initial Context and Given Information:**
   In $\triangle ABC$, we have \(a + c = 3b\). The incircle touches sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) at points \(D\) and \(E\) respectively. Let \(I\) be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$. We need to prove that points \(A\), \(C\), \(K\), and \(L\) are concyclic, where \(K\) is the reflection of \(D\) over \(I\) and \(L\) is the reflection of \(E\) over \(I\).

2. **Construct External Circle:**
   Let the external circle of $\triangle ABC$ (circumcircle) intersect \(BI\) again at point \(P\). It is known that point \(P\) is the midpoint of arc \(AC\) (not containing \(B\)).

3. **Identify Midpoint and Perpendicularity:**
   Denote \(M\) as the midpoint of \(AC\). Therefore, \(PM \perp AC\).

4. **Analyze Relationships Using Perpendiculars:**
   Denote the projection of point \(P\) on line \(DI\) as \(N\). Given \(a + c = 3b\), the semi-perimeter \(p\) is computed as:
   \[
   p = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = 2b
   \]
   Since the incircle touches at \(D\) and \(E\), we have:
   \[
   BD = BE = p - b = b = AC = 2 \cdot CM
   \]

5. **Establish Similarity and Use Angle Properties:**
   Note that \(\angle ABP = \angle ACP\) and \(\angle BDI = 90^\circ\) similarly implies \(\angle CMP = 90^\circ\). Thus, \(\triangle DBI \sim \triangle MCP\) with a similarity ratio of 2.

6. **Focus on Equal Distances and Similarity:**
   With \(PI = PC = PA\), and noting that \(\triangle DBI \sim \triangle NPI\), it follows:
   \[
   DI = 2 \cdot IN
   \]
   Hence \(N\) is the midpoint of \(IK\).

7. **Calculate and Confirm Equal Radii:**
   Thus, given the reflection properties:
   \[
   PK = PI \quad \text{and} \quad PL = PI
   \]

8. **Conclude the Concyclic Property:**
   Since \(A\), \(C\), \(K\), \(L\), and \(I\) all lie on the circle with center \(P\), we can conclude that \(A\), \(C\), \(K\), and \(L\) are concyclic.

\[
\boxed{ 
\text{A, C, K, and L are concyclic}
}
\]
