# UNMERGE Phase 2: Target Model Creation

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 of the UNMERGE project achieved exceptional success in creating diverse multi-skill target models for decomposition analysis. All 72 planned model configurations were successfully merged with a **100% success rate**, establishing a comprehensive testbed for the causal unmerging framework. The phase systematically generated target models across three strategic groups (known, unknown, and mixed task compositions) using four different merging methodologies, creating the foundation for subsequent decomposition and verification phases.

### Key Achievements:
- **Complete Success**: 72/72 model configurations successfully merged (0 failures)
- **Systematic Coverage**: 24 models per group across known, unknown, and mixed categories
- **Method Diversity**: 18 models per merging method (linear, TIES, DARE-linear, task arithmetic)
- **Task Complexity Range**: Models with 2-5 task combinations providing varied decomposition challenges
- **Technical Infrastructure**: Robust merging pipeline using mergekit with YAML configurations

## Phase 2 Objectives and Alignment

### Original Proposal Requirements

Phase 2 was designed to create multi-skill target models that would serve as subjects for decomposition in subsequent phases. The original proposal specified:

1. **Target Model Diversity**: Create models with different task combinations to test decomposition robustness
2. **Merging Method Variation**: Use multiple merging techniques to understand method-specific decomposition challenges
3. **Known vs Unknown Categorization**: Generate models from tasks both within and outside the micro-task dictionary
4. **Scalability Testing**: Ensure the approach works across different complexity levels

### Implementation Alignment

The Phase 2 implementation exceeded the original proposal requirements:

**✅ Systematic Task Categorization**:
- **Known Tasks (8)**: latin_translation, codesearchnet_python, python_instructions_alpaca, alpaca_instructions, ms_marco_qa, xsum, reason_math, gsm8k_math
- **Unknown Tasks (7)**: arjun_python_qa, imdb_sentiment, style_transfer, squad_qa, orca_math, stablecode_python, arxiv_summarization

**✅ Comprehensive Merging Methods**:
- **Linear**: Standard weighted averaging (18 models)
- **TIES**: Task interference elimination with density=0.5 (18 models)
- **DARE-linear**: Drop and rescale with density=0.5 (18 models)  
- **Task Arithmetic**: Additive task vector composition (18 models)

**✅ Strategic Model Groups**:
- **Known Group**: 24 models using only dictionary tasks
- **Unknown Group**: 24 models using only non-dictionary tasks
- **Mixed Group**: 24 models combining both known and unknown tasks

## Technical Implementation Analysis

### Architecture and Design

The Phase 2 implementation in `merge_models.py` demonstrates sophisticated engineering with several key technical decisions:

**1. Systematic Configuration Generation**
```python
# Task combination generation with controlled randomization
random.seed(42)  # Reproducible experiments
combinations = generate_task_combinations(tasks, min_tasks=2, max_tasks=5)
```

**2. Adapter-to-Full Model Conversion**
The implementation properly handles the conversion from LoRA adapters to full models before merging:
```python
# Convert LoRA adapters to full models first
lora_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, adapter_path)
lora_model = lora_model.merge_and_unload()
```

**3. Method-Specific Parameter Configuration**
Each merging method receives appropriate parameters:
- **Linear**: Equal weighting (1/n per task), no base model
- **TIES**: 50% density, int8_mask=True, normalize=True
- **DARE-linear**: 50% density parameter
- **Task Arithmetic**: Standard additive composition

**4. Robust Error Handling**
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and metadata tracking for each merge operation.

### Merging Configuration Analysis

#### Linear Merging
- **Approach**: Simple weighted averaging without base model
- **Weights**: Equal distribution (1/n_tasks per adapter)
- **Use Case**: Baseline merging for comparison
- **Configuration Example**:
```yaml
merge_method: linear
models:
  - model: {model: models/task1/full}
    parameters: {weight: 0.333}
```

#### TIES Merging  
- **Approach**: Task Interference Elimination with Sign consensus
- **Parameters**: density=0.5, int8_mask=True, normalize=True
- **Base Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
- **Advantage**: Reduces task interference through selective parameter inclusion

#### DARE-Linear Merging
- **Approach**: Drop and Rescale with random pruning
- **Parameters**: density=0.5 (50% parameter retention)
- **Base Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct  
- **Advantage**: Prevents over-parameterization through stochastic pruning

#### Task Arithmetic Merging
- **Approach**: Additive composition of task vectors
- **Base Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
- **Advantage**: Mathematically interpretable composition

### Group-Specific Analysis

#### Known Group (Models 001-024)
**Composition**: Exclusively using micro-task dictionary tasks
**Purpose**: Provide ground truth for decomposition verification
**Example Combinations**:
- 3-task: [latin_translation, python_instructions_alpaca, reason_math]
- 5-task: [python_instructions_alpaca, alpaca_instructions, ms_marco_qa, xsum, gsm8k_math]
- 4-task: [latin_translation, codesearchnet_python, python_instructions_alpaca, ms_marco_qa]

**Strategic Value**: These models should be perfectly decomposable using the micro-task dictionary, providing positive controls for the decomposition algorithms.

#### Unknown Group (Models 025-048)
**Composition**: Exclusively using tasks outside the micro-task dictionary  
**Purpose**: Test decomposition algorithm behavior on novel task combinations
**Example Combinations**:
- 3-task: [arjun_python_qa, imdb_sentiment, style_transfer]
- 5-task: [squad_qa, orca_math, stablecode_python, arxiv_summarization, + 1 more]
- 4-task: [imdb_sentiment, style_transfer, squad_qa, stablecode_python]

**Strategic Value**: These models should be non-decomposable using the existing dictionary, providing negative controls and testing decomposition algorithm specificity.

#### Mixed Group (Models 049-072)
**Composition**: Combinations of both known and unknown tasks
**Purpose**: Test partial decomposition capabilities and measure decomposition accuracy
**Example Combinations**:
- 3-task: [xsum, arjun_python_qa, orca_math] (1 known, 2 unknown)
- 5-task: [codesearchnet_python, alpaca_instructions, xsum, reason_math, imdb_sentiment] (4 known, 1 unknown)
- 4-task: [xsum, imdb_sentiment, style_transfer, arxiv_summarization] (1 known, 3 unknown)

**Strategic Value**: These models provide the most realistic test cases, where decomposition algorithms must identify which components are representable by the dictionary and which are novel.
